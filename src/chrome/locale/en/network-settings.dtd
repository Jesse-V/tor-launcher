<!ENTITY torsettings.bridgeHelp3 "Another way to find public bridge addresses is to send mail to bridges@torproject.org with the line 'get bridges' by itself in the body of the message. However, so we can make it harder for an attacker to learn lots of bridge addresses, you must send this request from an email address at one of the following domains: gmail.com or yahoo.com.">
